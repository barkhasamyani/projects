Traffic Congestion Management using Internet-of-Things<br>

Todays major problem: Traffic Congestion<br>

<b>Problem Statement:</b><br>
Public transportation available for the common people gets delayed due to traffic congestion. Common people who rely on public transportation have to suffer cause of that.<br>

<b>Proposed Solution:</b><br>
By controlling the reasons causing traffic congestion we can improve public transportation. Some of the solutions are,
	1.	Operating Existing Capacity More Efficiently – Getting More Out of What We Have.<br>
	2.	Adding More Capacity – Increasing the Number and Size of Highways and Providing More Transit and Freight Rail Service.<br>
	3.	Encouraging Travel and Land Use Patterns that Use the System in Less Congestion Producing Ways.<br>
<b>Object Model:</b>

Key Roles:<br>
System Admin Role: Responsibilities: Manages the entire System. Will create various enterprises and their respective admins.<br>
Enterprise Admin Role: Responsibilities: Manages the enterprise. Will create various Organizations and Employees.<br>
Commuter Role: Responsibilities: Manages the Car Driver Organization. Basically he is the one who informs if there is any Congestion.<br>
Event Handler Role: Responsibilities: Manages the Event Handler Organization. Basically he is the one who handles various Traffic Events.<br>
Construction Manager Role: Responsibilities: Manages the Construction Manager Organization. Basically he is the one who handles various Construction related events.<br>

<b>Technical Specifications:</b><br>
	1.	Individually designed and developed an enterprise level java swing application (Internet of Things based application) to help manage Traffic Congestion using a complex algorithm.<br>
	2.	Implemented Ecosystem Model using concepts of Object Oriented programming such as Polymorphism, Abstract Classes, Singleton pattern, Enumeration.<br>
	3.	Implemented factory design pattern along with the concept of work requests, work queues.<br>
	4.	Integrated JFreeChart API for graphically analyzing aggregated data through congestion sensors.<br>
	5.	Incorporated APIs such as SMS, Email, Google Maps and JX Browser as well for excellent user experience advanced functionality.<br>
	6.	The project can be used for facilitating actual traffic management.<br>

<b>Future Scope:</b><br>
This application can be expanded a lot. Huge scope exists in implementation of various Organizations within an enterprise. In future it can be used for betterment of public transportation. IOT can be used to detect the demand of public transportation at specific locations and then with the help of censors public transportation schedule can be made dynamic. Application can also be expanded for reverse direction as well. If developed properly, application will be very useful in reducing the amount of Traffic Congestion. Drivers can decide to select a path or not based on Weather and Traffic Congestion present on that path.
